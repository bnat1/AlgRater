# AlgRater
This c++ program go through large amounts of 3x3 algs to help determine if they are finger-frienldy. It looks at the number of regrips, rh vs lh ratio, and quarter turn metric (QTM) to give the algs grades out of 100. 

The idea is to input a filename for a file that contains many algorithms, then the program grades them, sorts them, and provides the top-x algs.
